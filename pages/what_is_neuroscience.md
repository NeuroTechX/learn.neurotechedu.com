Neuroscience is a study devoted to understanding the nervous system and its core components, the brain, the spinal cord and its neurons which innervate our entire body. This investigation occurs at multiple levels, from molecular synapses and cellular networks, to cognition and behavior, to brain imaging. Consequently, neuroscience involves multidisciplinary techniques and approaches, which include: molecular and cellular biology, physiology, biomedicine, behavioral science, cognitive psychology, electrical engineering, computer science and artificial intelligence.

Neuroscientists hope to understand how cellular circuits enable us to read and speak, how we bond with other humans, how we learn and retain information, how we experience pain, and how we feel motivation. They also hope to find causes for devastating disorders of the brain and body, as well as ways to prevent or cure them. Although there has been enormous progress in the field, much research remains to understand the full extent of how the nervous system works.

This introduction to neuroscience includes several sections analyzing the brain and the nervous system from different perspectives:

- [**The Nervous System**]({{ "/the_nervous_system/" | absolute_url }}) looks at how information flows through the central and peripheral nervous systems.
- [**Cellular Components**]({{ "/cellular_components/" | absolute_url }}) focuses on neurons, glial cells, and their electrochemical connections in detail.
- [**Neuroanatomy and Brain Organization**]({{ "/neuroanatomy_and_brain_organization/" | absolute_url }}) illustrates the anatomical components as well as mapping systems.
- [**Functional Systems of the Brain**]({{ "/functional_systems_of_the_brain/" | absolute_url }}) explores the sensory, motor, cognitive systems and more.
- [**Brain Diseases and Disorders**]({{ "/brain_diseases_and_disorders/" | absolute_url }})Brain Diseases and Disorders identifies things that can go wrong, possible treatments and cures.
